// workspace.mount: a new Workspace of a Branch, placed by LayerFS in one of
// the project's Sandboxes of its image (the lowest-numbered running one with
// a free slot, else a new one, started with the client's deployment). The
// image is `options.image`, else the deployment's; one project's Sandboxes
// may run different images. The Branch is found by name in this process's
// Store; the daemon binds its id. Returns the Workspace, `{ sandbox, path }`,
// its Sandbox's `image`, and `revived`: the `operator.sandbox.reopen` item of
// each Sandbox with saved overlays whose revive failed (its Workspaces stay
// unmounted and kept; the new Workspace is placed elsewhere).
